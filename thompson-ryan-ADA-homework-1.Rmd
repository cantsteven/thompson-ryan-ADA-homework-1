## Challenge 1

```{r quote}
library(tidyverse)

quote <- "There is grandeur in this view of life,
with its several powers, having been originally breathed
by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst
this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law
of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most
beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved."

quote2 <- gsub("\n", " ", quote)

split_quote <- str_split(quote2, pattern = fixed(" "))
split_quote2 <- unlist(split_quote)
split_quote2

every_fourth <- split_quote2[seq(from = 1, to = 65, by = 4)]
every_fourth

sort(every_fourth, decreasing = FALSE)
